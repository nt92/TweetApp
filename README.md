## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

As far as the submission is concerned, my autolayout is pretty poorly set up, but due to the deadline I will have to submit it now and work on cleaning up the autolayout before we dive into the next part of the Twitter app.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had a lot of trouble with VMWare this week and unfortunately my goals to do all of the optionals did not pan out in time because I was debugging VM stuff. I hope to in the future, clean up the UI and add all of the functionality detailed in the optionals, and make this a fully functioning twitter bot.

Also, getting strange errors with nil value was not helpful. I will try to fix that by tomorrow.
